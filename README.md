# Shopify

This is the project I worked to understand how spring boot functions. It is an online e-commerce clothing site. Not to lie, UI is inspired from the famous Little Closet template , with me making further changes in it and adding the necessary JS.

## Features
- Email authentication.
- Use of Spring Security.
- Add, Remove, View, Like items to cart.
- DAO Architecture
